# AgroBot
As an agricultural country, agriculture plays a crucial role in the economy of Bangladesh, providing livelihoods for millions of people. However, one of the challenges faced by farmers is the growth of weeds, which reduce crop yields, increase manual labor.However,a rover bot designed to detect and treat weeds offers an innovative solution to this problem.Utilizing advanced technologies such as computer vision, machine learning, and precision spraying mechanisms, the rover bot can autonomously navigate fields, accurately identify weeds, and apply targeted treatments. This reduces the need for harmful chemical herbicides, minimizing environmental impact and preserving soil health. Furthermore, the automation of weed control can significantly reduce labor costs, particularly in rural areas where workforce shortages during peak seasons can be a challenge. For a country like Bangladesh, where agriculture is predominantly small-scale and resource-limited, the implementation of a weed- detecting and treating rover bot could enhance productivity, improve sustainability, and contribute to food security by allowing farmers to focus more on crop care and management while reducing their dependence on manual labor and harmful chemicals. Our idea focuses on an affordable rover bot with the aforementioned features to support economically disadvantaged farmers.
